Notes
----------------
1. Focus on user work-flow rather than plethora of displayed data
2. avoid navigation bar when possible
3. remove fkey constraints for first inserted item, example will be on website
4. can add extra tables as necessary for work-flow ex. privileges, status, history, tasks, comments
5. have 1 approval chain, ex. manager creates project, president approves project
6. for final show part 1(sql) and part 2(rest/sim/carnot)
7. use column type "plain text with list of value" for foreign keys and boolean representation in pretty way
